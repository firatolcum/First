Challenge-1 : Tenth Power
Letâ€™s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number. In order to do this we need to do three things:

1-Set up the function header for tenth_power which accepts one parameter
2-Take the tenth power of the input value
3-Return the result
"""


def tenth_power(num):
    return num ** 10


print(tenth_power(2))  # 1024
