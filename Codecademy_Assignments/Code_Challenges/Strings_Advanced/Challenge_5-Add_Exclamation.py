Challenge 5 : Add Exclamation

Letâ€™s say we are writing a program that displays a large message on a blimp and we need to fill in any missing space if a short phrase is provided. Our function will accept a string and if the size is less than 20, it will fill in the remaining space with exclamation marks until the size reaches 20. If the provided string already has a length greater than 20, then we will simply return the original string. Here are the steps:

1. Define the function to accept one parameter for our string
2. Loop while the length of our input string is less than 20
3. Inside the loop, append an exclamation mark
4. Once done, return the result

# Solution 1 :


def add_exclamation(word):
    if len(word) < 20:
        while len(word) < 20:
            word += "!"
    else:
        return word
    return word


print(add_exclamation("Codecademy"))
# should print Codecademy!!!!!!!!!!
print(add_exclamation("Codecademy is the best place to learn"))
# should print Codecademy is the best place to learn

# Solution 2:


def add_exclamation(word):
    while(len(word) < 20):
        word += "!"
    return word
