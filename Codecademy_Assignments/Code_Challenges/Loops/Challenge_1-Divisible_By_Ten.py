Challenge-1 : Divisible By Ten
Letâ€™s start our code challenges with a function that counts how many numbers are divisible by ten from a list of numbers. This function will accept a list of numbers as an input parameter and use a loop to check each of the numbers in the list. Every time a number is divisible by 10, a counter will be incremented and the final count will be returned. These are the steps we need to complete this:

1-Define the function to accept one input parameter called nums
2-Initialize a counter to 0
3-Loop through every number in nums
4-Within the loop, if any of the numbers are divisible by 10, increment our counter
5-Return the final counter value

from typing import Counter


def divisible_by_ten(nums):
    counter = 0
    for i in nums:
        if i % 10 == 0:
            counter += 1
    return counter


print(divisible_by_ten([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]))
