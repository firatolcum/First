Challenge-3 : More Frequent Item
Let’s go back to our factory example. We have a conveyor belt of items where each item is represented by a different number. We want to know, out of two items, which one shows up more on our belt. To solve this, we can use a function with three parameters. One parameter for the list of items, another for the first item we are comparing, and another for the second item. Here are the steps:

1-Define the function to accept three parameters: the list, the first item, and the second item
2-Count the number of times item1 shows up in our list
3-Count the number of times item2 shows up in our list
4-If item1 shows up more, return item1. Otherwise, return item2

def more_frequent_item(lst, item1, item2):
    num1 = lst.count(item1)
    num2 = lst.count(item2)
    if num1 > num2:
        return item1
    else:
        return item2


print(more_frequent_item([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3))
