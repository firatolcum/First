Challenge-2 : Remove Middle
Our next function will remove all elements from a list with an index within a certain range. The function will accept a list, a starting index, and an ending index. All elements with an index between the starting and ending index should be removed from the list. Here are the steps:

1-Define the function to accept three parameters: the list, the starting index, and the ending index
2-Get all elements before the starting index
3-Get all elements after the ending index
4-Combine the two partial lists into the result
5-Return the result
