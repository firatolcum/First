Challenge-1 : Large Power
For the first code challenge, we are going to create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the following steps:

1-Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
2-Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
3-Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False
"""


def large_power(base, exponent):
    outcome = base**exponent
    if outcome > 5000:
        return True
    else:
        return False


print(large_power(2, 13))
# should print True
print(large_power(2, 12))
# should print False
